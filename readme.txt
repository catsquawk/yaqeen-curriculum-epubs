epub files for Yaqeen Institute's Islamic Curriculum
---
Will upload epub files here as I get through the curriculum.
Feel free to open an issue if you find a formatting/grammar/spelling issue in any of them.
Targeted towards self-learners who find it inconvenient to constantly switch between the lesson plan and presentation (and prefer the reduced eyestrain that comes with an ereader).
Worksheets not included, you'll have to print and complete those yourself.

These are all made by copy-pasting text from the lesson plan, adding formatting and slide images with Markdown before converting to epub with pandoc.
Takes about an hour for each lesson, shouldn't be too hard to do yourself if something's missing here.

PLEASE let me know if there's a better way to do this. I tried pdf2docx and *then* pandoc, but the resulting epub was terribly cluttered and poorly formatted. marker with some LLM would definitely work miles better, but I don't have the hardware for that.
